## Instructions for Tutorial Assignment

The key final assignment for the Data Science course is to create your own tutorial. Your tutorial has to communicate a specific quantitative skill - you can choose the level at which you pitch your tutorial and how advanced or introductory it is. You can create "part 2" tutorials where "part 1" is an existing Coding Club tutorial.

You are encouraged to add your peers to your tutorial development tutorials so that you can exchange feedback - remember that the best way to check if your tutorial makes sense is to have someone that is not you go through it.

__Note that the deadline for this challenge is 12 noon on 7th Dec 2018. Submission is via GitHub like with previous challenges, but you have to also submit a pdf version of your tutorial via Turnitin. Your submission on GitHub will represent a repository that is also a website (the tutorial on making tutorials below explains how to turn a GitHub repo into a website) and you can just save a pdf of your website, you don't need to be separately generating a pdf unless you want to.__

__Marking criteria:__

- Clear and logical structure to the tutorial that is easy to navigate with clear instructions - 25%

- A well-illustrated tutorial with figures and content that match the criteria from the Data Science challenges (e.g., axes are easy to read, code etiquette has been followed) - 25%

- Clear, concrete and measurable learning objectives (i.e., people can tell exactly what they are learning and when they have achieved each learning objective) - 20%

- Reproducibility - people can do the tutorial on their own, without assistance and without needing to pay for extra software, the code works and people can easily access any data needed to complete the tutorial - 20%

- Creative approach to teaching the learning objectives - 10%

All the other useful links we have shared with previous challenges and from the course reading - think of the tutorials you have done in the past - what did you like about those tutorials, what didn't work so well and could be improved.
